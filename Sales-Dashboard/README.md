# Sales Dashboard Project

This project is a **Sales Dashboard** created using **Tableau** to visualize sales data from 2020 to 2023. The dashboard provides a detailed view of key metrics, including total sales, profit, and quantities sold, with options to compare performance across multiple years.

## Overview

The dashboard enables interactive exploration of sales trends, profit margins, and product performance. It offers valuable insights for tracking business performance and supporting strategic decision-making.

## Features

- **KPI Metrics**: Displays total sales, profit, and quantity for selected years (2020–2023).
- **Year Selector**: Users can choose the year range for comparative analysis.
- **Sales & Profit by Subcategory**: Visualizes the performance of different product subcategories.
- **Trend Visualization**: Line charts showing sales and profit trends over time.
- **Interactive Filters**: Filters allow users to narrow down the data by time, region, and subcategories.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Tool Used**: Tableau
- **Data Source**: Sales dataset (2020–2023)
- **Visualization Types**: KPI metrics, bar charts, line charts, and comparison graphs

## How to Use

1. **Select Year Range**: Choose the desired year (2020–2023) to explore relevant data.
2. **View KPI Metrics**: Analyze total sales, profit, and quantities sold based on the selected year range.
3. **Subcategory Breakdown**: Review sales and profit performance by subcategory.

## Future Plans

I plan to extend this project by creating a **Customer Dashboard** that focuses on customer behavior, segmentation, and purchasing patterns.
